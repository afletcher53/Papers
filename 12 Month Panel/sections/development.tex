The training provided as part of the PhD with integrated PGDip replaces the standard Doctoral Development programme, and further activities outside of this are not required to be undertaken.\footnote{https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/slt-cdt-handbook/the-centre}. The PGDip component has multiple strands associated with it, such as participation in group work, a requirement for technical training, responsible research and innovation, attending discipline-specific lectures, involvement with journal clubs, outreach work from the department itself, and completion of the FCE6100 (Research Ethics and Integrity training) as part of CDT's COM61003. As evidence of active involvement with professional development, the author submits his logs from his first year of engagement with the process, which were submitted in June 2024 - see Appendix \ref{appendix:COM61003} and \ref{appendix:COM61004}. These are due yearly (i.e. every June)  as the programme progresses. Due to the large size of this, this is not included in this body of work but rather is included as additional PDFs for the readers.
