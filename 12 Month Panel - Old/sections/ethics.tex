This research will comply with the research ethics norms and rules outlined by the University of Sheffield. Most of the data sets used by this research (CLEF, Synergy, and RCV1-v2 data sets) would fall into the category of publicly available anonymised data/published media; hence, ethical approval is not required. 

However, the Jeb Bush email dataset contains unanonymised emails. Although it is publically available and used for research, an application for its use will be sought through the university's ethical approval process in due time.
