\textbf{Stage} & \textbf{Purpose} \\
\hline
1 & \textbf{Framing questions for a review:} The research question is structured and explicitly formulated. \\\hline
2 & \textbf{Identifying relevant work:} A wide range of databases are searched to identify research to be included. Potential research is first identified, screened, eligibility checked, and then a decision is made on the inclusion of that research \cite{tawfik_step_2019}. \\\hline
3 & \textbf{Assessing the quality of studies:} Research is tested for quality, such as minimum research design, and subjected to higher quality assessment checks, including tests for research heterogeneity. \\\hline
4 & \textbf{Summarizing the evidence:} Data synthesis occurs with tabulation of study characteristics and quality. Statistical testing is performed at this stage. \\\hline
5 & \textbf{Interpreting the findings:} Any issues highlighted in the previous steps should be addressed. Generate recommendations guided by reference to the strength of the evidence. \\
