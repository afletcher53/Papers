3. RetractionWatch Paper:

Check if there is a difference if running TF-IDF on discrete categorisation vs concatenated input.
Add in information about how the input features are created.
- The cleaning Process  
- Saturated TFIDF
Recomputing Precision / Recall per class.

4. Stopping Criteria
- Stop = if sens LCB > 0.5 or UCB < 0.5 run seperately for spec. 
- Work saved against 0.7 recall.
- How many times do you get the answer to the question right. 
- Total recall If LCB > 0.5 Yes, UCB < 0.5 No, if 0.5 in CI -> Unknown. 
- Match out approach to Total Recalla and Recall based ones on agreement. 
- Integrate estimate of recall into stopping criteria?
- Maybe exclude the runs where the total recall doesnt reach a concensus in calculating a answer.
